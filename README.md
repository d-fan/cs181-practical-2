This will save all features that get extracted. When running for the first time, use
	```
	python classifier.py
	```
You should always specify `load` unless you have added new feature extractors. 
	```
	python classifier.py load
	```
To discard previously saved data, just rerun without `load`:
	```
	python classifier.py
	```
