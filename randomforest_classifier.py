## This file provides starter code for extracting features from the xml files and
## for doing some learning.
##
## The basic set-up: 
## ----------------
## main() will run code to extract features, learn, and make predictions.
## 
## extract_feats() is called by main(), and it will iterate through the 
## train/test directories and parse each xml file into an xml.etree.ElementTree, 
## which is a standard python object used to represent an xml file in memory.
## (More information about xml.etree.ElementTree objects can be found here:
## http://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html
## and here: http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/03/15/processing-xml-in-python-with-elementtree/)
## It will then use a series of "feature-functions" that you will write/modify
## in order to extract dictionaries of features from each ElementTree object.
## Finally, it will produce an N x D sparse design matrix containing the union
## of the features contained in the dictionaries produced by your "feature-functions."
## This matrix can then be plugged into your learning algorithm.
##
## The learning and prediction parts of main() are largely left to you, though
## it does contain code that randomly picks class-specific weights and predicts
## the class with the weights that give the highest score. If your prediction
## algorithm involves class-specific weights, you should, of course, learn 
## these class-specific weights in a more intelligent way.
##
## Feature-functions:
## --------------------
## "feature-functions" are functions that take an ElementTree object representing
## an xml file (which contains, among other things, the sequence of system calls a
## piece of potential malware has made), and returns a dictionary mapping feature names to 
## their respective numeric values. 
## For instance, a simple feature-function might map a system call history to the
## dictionary {'first_call-load_image': 1}. This is a boolean feature indicating
## whether the first system call made by the executable was 'load_image'. 
## Real-valued or count-based features can of course also be defined in this way. 
## Because this feature-function will be run over ElementTree objects for each 
## software execution history instance, we will have the (different)
## feature values of this feature for each history, and these values will make up 
## one of the columns in our final design matrix.
## Of course, multiple features can be defined within a single dictionary, and in
## the end all the dictionaries returned by feature functions (for a particular
## training example) will be unioned, so we can collect all the feature values 
## associated with that particular instance.
##
## Two example feature-functions, first_last_system_call_feats() and 
## system_call_count_feats(), are defined below.
## The first of these functions indicates what the first and last system-calls 
## made by an executable are, and the second records the total number of system
## calls made by an executable.
##
## What you need to do:
## --------------------
## 1. Write new feature-functions (or modify the example feature-functions) to
## extract useful features for this prediction task.
## 2. Implement an algorithm to learn from the design matrix produced, and to
## make predictions on unseen data. Naive code for these two steps is provided
## below, and marked by TODOs.
##
## Computational Caveat
## --------------------
## Because the biggest of any of the xml files is only around 35MB, the code below 
## will parse an entire xml file and store it in memory, compute features, and
## then get rid of it before parsing the next one. Storing the biggest of the files 
## in memory should require at most 200MB or so, which should be no problem for
## reasonably modern laptops. If this is too much, however, you can lower the
## memory requirement by using ElementTree.iterparse(), which does parsing in
## a streaming way. See http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/03/15/processing-xml-in-python-with-elementtree/
## for an example.
